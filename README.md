# Flower Recognition Project
## Goals
The goal of the project is to create a simple flower recognition application with pretrained CNN-s. The tasks are experiment tracking, hyperparameter optimalization and adding GUI, using Kivy. The image recognition task is very simple, therefore very high performance is expected.
## Dataset
The training dataset is a relatively clean [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kausthubkannan/5-flower-types-classification-dataset). Each class (lilly, lotus, orchid, sunflower and tulip) has 1000 images.
